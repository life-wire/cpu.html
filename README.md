Alternately referred to as a processor, central processor, or microprocessor, the CPU (pronounced sea-pea-you) is the central processing unit of the computer. A computer's CPU handles all instructions it receives from hardware and software running on the computer. For example, the CPU processed the instructions to use a web browser to open and display this web page on your computer.

## What does the CPU do?

The CPU's main function is to take input from a peripheral (keyboard, mouse, printer, etc) or computer program, and interpret what it needs. The CPU then either outputs information to your monitor or performs the peripheral's requested task.

## Components of the CPU

ALU (arithmetic logic unit) - performs mathematical, logical, and decision operations.
CU (control unit) - directs all the processors operations.

## Types of CPUs

In the past, computer processors used numbers to identify the processor and help identify faster processors. For example, the Intel 80486 (486) processor is faster than the 80386 (386) processor. After the introduction of the Intel Pentium processor (which would technically be the 80586), all computer processors started using names like Athlon, Duron, Pentium, and Celeron.

Today, in addition to the different names of computer processors, there are different architectures (32-bit and 64-bit), speeds, and capabilities. Below is a list of the more common types of CPUs for home or business computers.

## How fast does a CPU transfer data?

As with any device that utilizes electrical signals, the data travels very near the speed of light, which is 299,792,458 m/s. How close to the speed of light a signal can get depends on the medium (metal in wire) through which it's traveling. Most electrical signals are traveling at about 75 to 90% the speed of light.
